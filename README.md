## VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street

## What is this repo or project? 
In this homework assignment, I will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data

## How does it work?
In this project I Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information per year at once:
  * The ticker symbol.
  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The total stock volume of the stock
Finally I used conditional formatting that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.

## What is the goal of this project?
The goal of this project is to sumarize multiple yearly stock data and highlight the changes from the beging of the year to the end of year in number and percentage as well as sumarize per ticker total stock volume in the respective year. Using VBA script allows to work in an structured an scalable way optimizing time and standarizing visualization formats.
